__One Hub to rule them all, One Hub to find them;<br/>
One Hub to bring them all and in the sunlight bind them.__<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;_with apologies to J.R.R. Tolkien_

The U.S. Digital Service Hub is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)-based
documentation platform that aims to help the [United States Digital Service
teams](http://wh.gov/usds) organize and easily share their information, share
their information, and to enable easy exploration of the connections between
team members, projects, and skill sets across government agencies. It works by
consolidating information from other [18F Hub](https://github.com/18F/hub)
instances.

## Code

The code for the U.S. Digital Service Hub can be found in the [18F/usds-hub
GitHub repository](https://github.com/18F/usds-hub).
